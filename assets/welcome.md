Hello There, welcome to my tool to build Trench Crusade lists. I have some ideas about how I did not like other roster apps, and this is my chance to do something different:

The main difference that I was trying to have, is to avoid multiple taps in the screen to visualize the info that you need. It may seem a little cluttered, and I am hopping that we can clean this up without compromising the amount of interactions that you need to get somewhere.

I never like the system of adding units and then having to validate the list, this introduces a number of interaction problems and frustrations. My take on this problem is that it should not be posible to build an illegal list in the first place: mandatory units are prefilled, adding units or items will only allow you to add a valid one at the time, deletes will check for list sanity... And so on. Please notice that this is inteded for the writting of the first list, not to be used in campain mode, which will require a completelly different system.

Some important notes:
- Roster Lists are intelectual property of Trench Crusade. I clame no ownership and I hope they do not excommunicate me for doing this!
- This is a work in progress, please be kind with errors'
- This tool uses some basic storage/cookies mechanisms for its normal operation, by using the tool you accept them as well.
