Hello There, welcome to my tool to build Trench Crusade lists. I have some ideas about how I did not like other roster apps, and this is my chance to do something different:

I never like the system of adding units and then having to validate the list. My take on this problem is that it should not be possible to build an illegal list in the first place: mandatory units are prefilled, adding units or items will only allow you to add a valid one at the time, deletes will check for list sanity... And so on. Please notice that this is intended for the writing of the first list, not to be used in campaign mode, which will require a completely different system.

Some important notes:
- Roster Lists are intellectual property of Trench Crusade. I claim no ownership and I hope they do not excommunicate me for doing this!
- This is a work in progress, please be kind with errors'
- This tool uses some basic storage/cookies mechanisms for its normal operation, by using the tool you accept them as well.
